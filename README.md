## Introduction

The swiss covid certificate system can be used by authorized third party systems in order to generate, revoke and verify covid certificates compatible with the EU digital green certificate. This repository contains technical information about how to integrate third party systems.

The swiss covid certificate system is hosted and maintained by [FOITT](https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home.html).

## Third party system integration

### Prerequisites

1. Only authorized users (natural persons) can access the generation and revokation API. Authorized users are determined by the swiss cantons or [FOPH](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home.html).
2. Verification API is freely accessible.
3. Third party systems have to sign an agreement with [FOITT](https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home.html) in order to access the generation and verification API.

### Integration achitecture

#### Integration with OneTime password

The use of the generation and revokation API is done by using an OTP that has been loaded beforehand in the primary system and introduced in the REST API request. The OTP has a limited validity.

1. The authorized user previously registered and recognised by [eIAM](https://www.eiam.admin.ch/pages/eiam_en.html?c=eiam&l=en&ll=1) can obtain an OTP by logging to the [Web management UI](https://www.covidcertificate.admin.ch/) page.
2. When the authorized user accesses the [Web management UI](https://www.covidcertificate.admin.ch/), its rights are verified by [eIAM](https://www.eiam.admin.ch/pages/eiam_en.html?c=eiam&l=en&ll=1)
3. The authorized user must insert the OTP in the primary system so that it is transmitted when calling the REST API.
4. One-way authentication is used to create the TLS tunnel to protect the data transfer.
5. The OTP is transferred so that the authorized user can be identified, as header of the request.
6. The content is hashed and signed with primary key of the "SwissGov Regular CA 01" certificate distributed to the primary system.
7. The dataset structured as JSON Schema is created and transported within the secured TLS tunnel.
8. The Management Service REST API checks the integrity of the data and signature received and the OTP.

### Security architecture

#### Authorized user

The authorized users are onboarded in [eIAM](https://www.eiam.admin.ch/pages/eiam_en.html?c=eiam&l=en&ll=1) and can use a [CHLogin](https://www.eiam.admin.ch/?c=f!chlfaq!pub&l=en) or a [HIN](https://www.hin.ch/hin-anschluss/elektronische-identitaeten/) identity. They access the API by sending an OneTime password (OTP as [JSON Web Token - JWT](https://jwt.io/)) generated from the [Web management UI](https://www.covidcertificate.admin.ch/).

#### TLS tunnel

A TLS tunnel (single way authentication) is made between the primary system and the API gateway. One "SwissGov Regular CA 01" certificate is delivered to each primary system for this purpose.

#### Content signature

The content transferred to the REST API is signed with the "SwissGov Regular CA 01" certificate. The public key of the "SwissGov Regular CA 01" certificate has not to be added to the API request.

## Data

3 types of covid certificate can be produced: vaccination, test or recovery. One covid certificate contains only one type. The personal data are common to all certificate. The other data are specific to the type of certificate.
