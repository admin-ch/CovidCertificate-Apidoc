## Introduction

The swiss covid certificate system can be used by authorized third party systems in order to generate, revoke and verify covid certificates compatible with the EU digital green certificate. This repository contains technical information about how to integrate third party systems.

The swiss covid certificate system is hosted and maintained by the [FOITT](https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home.html).

## Certificate Generation and Revocation API

### HOWTO become a system integrator using the API

If you are a primary system integrator, you can follow the following steps in order to use the generation and revocation API:

1. Indicate your interest to [Covid-Zertifikat@bag.admin.ch](mailto:Covid-Zertifikat@bag.admin.ch).
2. Receive a test PKI certificate of the type ["SwissGov Regular CA 01"](https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home/subsites/allgemeines-zur-swiss-government-pki/rootzertifikate/swiss-government-root-ca-ii.html) from [FOITT](https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home.html) so that the primary system integration can be developed and tested.
3. Sign an agreement with [FOITT](https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home.html). This is a condition for receiving a production PKI certificate of the type ["SwissGov Regular CA 01"](https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home/subsites/allgemeines-zur-swiss-government-pki/rootzertifikate/swiss-government-root-ca-ii.html).
4. If the test is successful and an agreement is signed, receive a production PKI certificate of the type ["SwissGov Regular CA 01"](https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home/subsites/allgemeines-zur-swiss-government-pki/rootzertifikate/swiss-government-root-ca-ii.html) from [FOITT](https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home.html) in order to generate official swiss covid certificates.
5. REST API is free of charge.
6. Batch processing is possible, but please avoid to request more than 2 covid certificates per second. In case of doubts, contact us with [Covid-Zertifikat@bag.admin.ch](mailto:Covid-Zertifikat@bag.admin.ch).

### Third party system integration

There are two methods to generate and revoke covid certificates:

1. Use the Web management UI ([prod](https://www.covidcertificate.admin.ch/) - [test](https://www.covidcertificate-a.admin.ch/)). Only authorized users determined by the cantons can use the Web management UI ([prod](https://www.covidcertificate.admin.ch/) - [test](https://www.covidcertificate-a.admin.ch/)).
2. Integrate the REST API within a primary system (system used by health professionals to manage vaccine, test and recovery information). Only authorized users determined by the cantons can use the REST API. Only primary systems determined by [FOITT](https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home.html) can access the REST API.

This documentation applies to the second use case presented above.

#### Prerequisites in order to access the API

1. Only authorized users (natural persons) can access the generation and revocation API. Authorized users are determined by the swiss cantons or [FOPH](https://www.bag.admin.ch/bag/en/home.html).
2. Third party systems have to sign an agreement with [FOITT](https://www.bit.admin.ch/bit/en/home.html) in order to access the generation and revocation API.

#### Integration architecture

##### Integration with one-time password

To use the generation and revocation API a one-time password is required that can be obtained form the Web management UI ([prod](https://www.covidcertificate.admin.ch/) - [test](https://www.covidcertificate-a.admin.ch/)).
This one-time password needs to be included in every REST API request. It is valid for 12 hours.
After expiry a new one-time password has to be generated.

1. The authorized user previously registered and recognized by [eIAM](https://www.eiam.admin.ch/pages/eiam_en.html?c=eiam&l=en&ll=1) can obtain a one-time password by signing in to the Web management UI ([prod](https://www.covidcertificate.admin.ch/) - [test](https://www.covidcertificate-a.admin.ch/)) page.
2. Upon signing in to the Web management UI ([prod](https://www.covidcertificate.admin.ch/) - [test](https://www.covidcertificate-a.admin.ch/)), the authorized users rights are verified by [eIAM](https://www.eiam.admin.ch/pages/eiam_en.html?c=eiam&l=en&ll=1).
3. The authorized user must insert the one-time password in the primary system so that it is transmitted when calling the REST API.
4. One-way authentication is used to create the TLS tunnel and therefor protect the data transfer.
5. The one-time password is transferred in the requests JSON payload. [See: API doc](https://editor.swagger.io/?url=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/admin-ch/CovidCertificate-Apidoc/main/api-doc.yaml)
6. The content is hashed and signed with the primary key of the "SwissGov Regular CA 01" certificate distributed to the primary system. [See: Content signature](#content-signature).
7. The dataset structured as JSON Schema is created and transported within the secured TLS tunnel.
8. The Management Service REST API checks the integrity of the data with the received signature and verifies the the one-time password.

#### Security architecture

##### Authorized user

The authorized users are onboarded in [eIAM](https://www.eiam.admin.ch/pages/eiam_en.html?c=eiam&l=en&ll=1) and can use a [CHLogin](https://www.eiam.admin.ch/?c=f!chlfaq!pub&l=en) or a [HIN](https://www.hin.ch/hin-anschluss/elektronische-identitaeten/) identity. They access the API by sending an OneTime password (OTP as [JSON Web Token - JWT](https://jwt.io/)) generated from the Web management UI ([prod](https://www.covidcertificate.admin.ch/) - [test](https://www.covidcertificate-a.admin.ch/)).

##### TLS tunnel

A TLS tunnel (single way authentication) is made between the primary system and the API gateway. One "SwissGov Regular CA 01" certificate is delivered to each primary system for this purpose.

##### Content signature

The content transferred to the REST API is signed with the private key of the certificate issued by "SwissGov Regular CA 01".

Given the JSON payload to be sent (data used to create the covid certificate or revocation data including the one-time password)), the process is as follows:

1. Primary system create a canonicalized text representation by removing all spaces, tabs, carriage returns and newlines from the payload. The regex `/[\n\r\t ]/gm` can be used.
2. Primary system encodes gets a UTF8 byte representation of that canonicalized text.
3. Primary system signs that byte representation using the algorithm "RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5" from [RFC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3447). Most implementations name the algorithm `SHA256withRSA`.
4. Primary system encodes the signature as base64 string.
5. Primary system places the base64 encoded signature in the request header `X-Signature`.

###### Java signature sample

```java
// load the key
PrivateKey privateKey = this.getCertificate();
// canonicalize
String normalizedJson = payload.replaceAll("[\\n\\r\\t ]", "");
byte[] bytes = normalizedJson.getBytes(StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
// sign
Signature signature = Signature.getInstance("SHA256withRSA");
signature.initSign(privateKey);
signature.update(bytes);
String signatureString = Base64.getEncoder().encodeToString(signature.sign());
```

###### .NET signature sample

```c#
// create RSA from certificate
X509Certificate2 cert = GetCertificate();
RSA rsaSignature = cert.GetRSAPrivateKey();

// normalize json
Regex normalizedJsonReplaceRegex = new Regex("[\\n\\r\\t ]");
string normalizedJson = normalizedJsonReplaceRegex.Replace(payload, string.Empty);

// sign
byte[] signatureBytes = rsaSignature.SignData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(normalizedJson), HashAlgorithmName.SHA256, RSASignaturePadding.Pkcs1);

// convert signature to Base64 string
string signatureString = Convert.ToBase64String(signatureBytes);
```

###### Node.js TypeScript signature sample

```typescript
// load the key
const pemEncodedKey = fs.readFileSync(privateKeyFile)
const privateKeyObject = crypto.createPrivateKey(pemEncodedKey)
// canonicalize
const regex = /[\n\r\t ]/gm
const canonicalPayload = payload.replace(regex, '')
const bytes = Buffer.from(canonicalMessage, 'utf8')
// sign
const sign = crypto.createSign('RSA-SHA256')
sign.update(bytes)
const signature = sign.sign(privateKeyObject)
const base64encodedSignature = signature.toString('base64')
// set request header
headers['X-Signature'] = base64encodedSignature
```

###### More samples

There are samples scripts at <https://github.com/admin-ch/CovidCertificate-Api-Scripts>.

### Request - Certificate data

3 types of covid certificate can be produced: vaccination, test or recovery. One covid certificate contains only one type.
The configuration and personal data sections are the same for all covid certificates. The other data sections are specific to the type of certificate.

One generation request generates always one single covid certificate.

#### Configuration data

Mandatory data necessary for all types of certificates:

- **otp**: the one time password which has to be generated in the [Web management UI (test environment)](https://www.covidcertificate-a.admin.ch/).
  - Format: string

#### Personal data

Mandatory data appearing in all types of certificates:

- **familyName**: family name of the covid certificate owner.
  - Format: string, maxLength: 80 CHAR.
  - Example: "Rochat"
- **givenName**: first name of the covid certificate owner.
  - Format: string, maxLength: 80 CHAR.
  - Example: "Céline"
- **dateOfBirth**: date of birth of the covid certificate owner.
  - Format: ISO 8601 date without time.
  - Example: "1964-03-14"
- **language**: the national language used to create the covid certificate PDF.
  The PDF always contains English translations.
  - Accepted languages are: `de`, `it`, `fr`, `rm`.

#### Address data

Optional data for paper-based delivery of the certificate.
If this data is passed, a printout of the certificate will be sent to the specified address.
The first line of the address is derived from the personal data.
Therefore, the attributes givenName and familyName are concatenated to build this line.
Only one delivery method can be used in an API request: address data can't used together with transfer data.

- **streetAndNr**: street and house number of the recipient.  
  - Format: string.
  - Example: "Musterweg 4b"
- **zipCode**: zip code of the recipient.
  - Format: integer, maxLength: 4 CHAR, minLength: 4 CHAR.
  - Example: 3000
- **city**: city the recipient lives in.
  - Format: string.
  - Example: "Bern"
- **cantonCodeSender**: abbreviation of the canton *issuing* the certificate. This can be different from the canton the recipient of the certificiate lives in. The abbreviation is mapped to a predefined address and used as the sender of the letter when sending the printout by mail.  
  - Format: string.
  - Example: "BE"

#### Transfer data - appCode

Transfer data is used to securely deliver the covid certificate into the Covid Cert app via the InApp delivery mechanism.
Only one delivery method can be used in an API request: transfer data cannot be combined with address data.

- **appCode**: code generated by the app allowing the secure direct transfer of the covid certificate to the Covid Cert app. 
  - Format: string with 9 characters
  - Example: "Y8P8ECFN8"

In case of problem with the InApp delivery backend, the system still sets the http response status code 200 and returns the QRCode and the PDF. 
Additionally, the response contains the optional attribute **appDeliveryError**. 
If this attribut exists in the response, then the covid certificate has not been transferred to the Covid Cert app. 

**appDeliveryError** may contain the following errorCode / errorMessage combination. 

- `errorCode:476, "errorMessage": "Unknown app code."` 
  Reasons might be that the appCode is not valid any more, was already used or did not exist at all.
- `errorCode:558, "errorMessage": "App delivery failed due to a technical error."`
  Technical issue in the InApp delivery backend.
  You can try to submit the same request later. 

##### Transfer code validation

A transfer code consists of 9 characters.

The first 8 are randomly chosen from the following 29-character alphabet (code points): **`1234567890ABCDEFHKMNPRSTUWXYZ`**.
Note that the following characters are left out to reduce confusion: "0, G, I, J, L, O, Q, V".

The final 9th character is a check character (a.k.a checksum, check digit).
It is computed using the [Luhn mod N algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_mod_N_algorithm).
Please use the alphabet defined above for the computation.

The following are examples of valid transfer codes:

```
Y8P8ECFN8
HDTYRB66W
YS6R7H88T
K42K6F7R2
3BY8DAZYS
